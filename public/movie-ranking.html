<h1>Tim's Top Movie Picks!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Goonies</h3>
<p>This is hands down my favorite movie. I bought the illustrated book to read to my four and two year olds. They love it!</p>
<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>This movie is iconic for a reason. Also, my age might start to become apparent...</p>
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>This movie somehow turned out better than the first one. A rare feat in filmography!</p>
